# Component Placement Configuration
# Perlin noise-based organic clustering for realistic PCB layouts

# Perlin noise parameters
perlin:
  scale: 30.0              # Noise scale factor (larger = smoother transitions)
  octaves: 4               # Number of noise detail levels
  persistence: 0.5         # Amplitude decay per octave (0-1)
  lacunarity: 2.0          # Frequency increase per octave
  seed: null               # Random seed (null = random, or specify integer for reproducibility)

# Vignette effect (density falloff from board edges)
vignette:
  enabled: true            # Enable edge density falloff
  strength: 0.7            # Falloff strength (0-1, higher = stronger edge falloff)

# Component counts and spacing by size category
components:
  small:
    count: 100             # Number of small components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs)
    spacing: 2.0           # Minimum spacing between components (mm)

  medium:
    count: 30              # Number of medium components (8-pin ICs, diodes)
    spacing: 5.0           # Minimum spacing (mm)

  large:
    count: 18              # Number of large components (32-pin ICs, connectors)
    spacing: 8.0           # Minimum spacing (mm)

# Board dimensions
board:
  width: 100.0             # Board width (mm)
  height: 100.0            # Board height (mm)

# Component type distribution (weights)
# Higher weight = more likely to be selected
component_types:
  small:
    resistor: 40           # 40% resistors
    capacitor: 35          # 35% capacitors
    led: 15                # 15% LEDs
    diode: 10              # 10% diodes

  medium:
    ic_8pin: 50            # 50% 8-pin ICs
    ic_16pin: 30           # 30% 16-pin ICs
    connector_small: 20    # 20% small connectors

  large:
    ic_32pin: 40           # 40% 32-pin ICs
    ic_64pin: 20           # 20% 64-pin ICs
    connector_large: 40    # 40% large connectors

# Rotation settings
rotation:
  snap_angle: 90.0         # Snap rotations to multiples of this angle (degrees)
  allow_45deg: false       # Allow 45-degree rotations (in addition to 90-degree)
  randomize: true          # Randomize rotation within snap angles
